    <h1>Guanajuato!</h1>
   <div>
     <p>Here are videos and places of the beautiful city of Guanajuato in a small town called Arroyo De La Luna. Guanajuato also has some really unique places outside of Arroyo De La Luna that make it really stand out too. One of the most popular is the Museum of the Mummies, where you can see naturally preserved mummies that were discovered because of the region’s unusual soil and climate. It’s a little creepy but super fascinating. Another spot that everyone talks about is the Callejón del Beso, or Alley of the Kiss. The alley is so narrow that the balconies almost touch, and there’s a legend that says if you kiss your partner on the third step, you’ll get fifteen years of happiness together. Places like these are what make Guanajuato feel so full of mystery, romance, and history all at once. </p>
